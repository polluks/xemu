Files in this directory are not standaline C files but are included by various
other C files. These are for only separating things not to have some giant
C file hard to navigate and maintain then. Indeed, it's a questionable trick.

gui_*.c files are the base abstractions of GUI backends, included by
../emutools_gui.c

osd.c and osd.h are basic OSD primitives used by both of the OSD notification
layer of Xemu, and (WIP) OSD GUI implementation. They're included by
../emutools.c and ../emutools.h They were part of the mentioned ../ files,
however this is a separation to make it more easy to maintain, with some
modifications as well how it worked in the past. Please note, that these
files are needed by basic Xemu builds as well, even without the actual
OSD GUI, as the OSD notification feature of Xemu is not dependent of the
GUI itself.

popular_user_funcs.c is also included by ../emutools_gui.c and contains
"popular" GUI features, so the actual emulators does not need to implement
as their own, all the time.
