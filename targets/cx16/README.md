A VERY reduimentary Commander X16 emulator. It's basically more about to
develop my emulator framework (Xemu) with another "target" more, than a
usable X16 emulator for an average user at this stage. Surely you WANT
to use Commander X16's team emulator instead!!

Currently:

* fixed text mode on Layer-1 only, for the default KERNAL mode ...
* no precise VGA signal emulation, no border, no raster IRQ, almost no anything ...
* no SD-card
* questionable keyboard input quality (PS/2 emulation ...)
* no sound
* no sane speed control on the emulation
