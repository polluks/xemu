		"Use the cursor up/down keys to scroll this message.\n\n"

		"~Quick jump-start for you:~\n\n"

		"~TL;DR~ if you don't want to read all of these, you can use Xemu's menu to open "
		"a web page with your default browser which can help to get the needed ROM. To do this "
		"right click into the emulator window, choose \"~Help (online)~\" and \"~Xemu MEGA65 help "
		"page~\" within that sub-menu.\n\n"

		"~The long story:~\n\n"

		"This message comes from Xemu's built-in \"stub\" ROM, ready to be replaced with "
		"some real ROM to be able to do anything useful. The reason you see this running "
		"now is the fact of lacking MEGA65.ROM file on your emulated SD-card. Once you "
		"have a MEGA65.ROM file installed it will be used instead.\n\n"

		"Unfortunately, because of legal "
		"reasons, it's not possible to include the real ROM. MEGA65 project has an "
		"on-going effort to write an open-source free ROM called \"~open-ROMs~\" project, "
		"however it's not yet ready for general usage at all.\n\n"

		"Thus you ~almost certainly~ "
		"need the \"proprietary\" ROM, often called \"~closed-ROMs~\" project, it's an enhanced "
		"and bug-fixed version of the original C65 ROM, with improved BASIC and other "
		"MEGA65 features. However being a derivate work based on original C65 ROM, it "
		"cannot be used without the blessing of the repspective owner of the original "
		"Commodore(TM) rights, it's not freely distributable, and certainly cannot be "
		"included in an open-source GNU/GPL emulator, like Xemu. That ROM on the other "
		"hand is legally licensed to any (real) MEGA65 owners by the copyright holders.\n\n"

		"~About this ROM:~\n\n"

		"This ROM is an actual machine language code (contained by Xemu) written in "
		"assembly. Easter egg: if you're patient enough to even read this, you may want to "
		"try the 's' key, it won't do anything useful now (restart), but may do something "
		"other in the future. Who knows.\n\n"

		"Thanks for your patience and understanding.\n\n"
