Unfinished try to write a PC emulator using Fake86's reworked CPU emulation!

Do not use this (yet) ...

Note, that it should have unified with my tree of Fake86 (fork of the original
Fake86). Both of them may contain useful modifications/cleanups on the CPU emulation
which should be important to make nicer first ...
