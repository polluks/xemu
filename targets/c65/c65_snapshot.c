/* The heart of the Snapshot handling. For the Xemu level snapshot support (both loading and saving)
   A definition list like this must be created. Each entry defines a block type, a user parameter,
   a load and save callback. Callbacks can be NULL to signal that no need to handle that for load or
   save (that is: it's possible to support loading a block which is never written though on save).
   The last entry MUST have a NULL entry in the place of block-identify string. This last entry can
   specify callbacks too, if it's given it means, that Xemu snapshot handler will call those callbacks
   at the end of loading or saving a snapshot. It's especially useful in case of "load finalization"
   for example, when an emulator needs to execute some extra code to really use the loaded state. The
   user parameter is accessible for the callbacks. Some of these callbacks are common code, ie
   CIA/CPU/SID can be included this way without any emulator-specific snapshot code, and realized
   in the shared/common code base. */
