# Commodore LCD

Commodore LCD is an almost totally unknown, never released 8 bit machine from
Commodore. It is a portable machine, with LCD screen, thus the name. It is
estimated that only 4-5 units exist at max.

Commodore LCD had no working emulator at all. I (Gabor Lenart aka LGB) made
the world's first working emulator, in hand written Javascript, running inside
a web browser, later ported to native C application. Even later, it formed
of one of basis (with the EP128 emulator) of the Xemu project.

Later, I also helped a guy to have a working emulator inside the mame/mess
project, so they can have emulation on this nice machine as well, with my
help.
