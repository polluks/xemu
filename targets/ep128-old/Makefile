## Collection of *simple* emulators of some 8 bits machines using SDL2 library,
## including the Commodore LCD and Commodore 65 too.
##
## This is my Xep128 (Enterprise-128 emulator) being ported to the Xemu project.
## Still it's mainly do many things on its own, unlike any other targets in the
## Xemu projects. Though, the build system and Z80 emulation core (Z80ex) is
## from Xemu now!
