   This is an odd emulator, emulating a Commodore 64 like machine only for the
   level needed for a special version of GEOS to be able to run on it.
   You should have a really special one with own disk drive etc, since there
   is no hardware support for drive emulation etc, but it's built in the emulator
   with a kind of CPU trap! The purpose: know GEOS better and slowly replace
   more and more functions on C/emulator level, so at one point it's possible
   to write a very own version of GEOS without *any* previously used code in
   the real GEOS. Then it can be even ported to other architectures GEOS wasn't
   mean to run ever.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   One interesting plan: write a GEOS emulator which does not use VIC-II bitmapped
   screen anymore, but the GEOS functions mean to be targeted a "modern UI toolkit",
   ie GTK, so a dozens years old (unmodified) GEOS app would be able to run on a PC
   with modern look and feel, ie anti-aliased fonts, whatever ...
