; This is a 6K (padded to ...) sized Commodore LCD ROM just for testing.
; Can be compiled with CA65 assembler from the CC65 suite.

;
;    This is an ongoing work to rewrite my old Commodore LCD emulator:
;
;       * Commodore LCD emulator, C version.
;       * (C)2013,2014 LGB Gabor Lenart
;       * Visit my site (the better, JavaScript version of the emu is here too): http://commodore-lcd.lgb.hu/
;
;    The goal is - of course - writing a primitive but still better than previous Commodore LCD emulator :)
;    Note: I would be interested in VICE adoption, but I am lame with VICE, too complex for me :)
;
;    This emulator based on my previous try (written in C), which is based on my previous JavaScript
;    based emulator, which was the world's first Commodore LCD emulator.
