-------------------------------- WARNINGS -----------------------------------

Warning! This directory is mostly interesting for Xemu developers and similar
purposes. DO NOT do anything here, if you want only to use / compile Xemu at
your own, but not dealing with the emulators more closely (ie, modifying
Xemu's source itself and such).

If you really want, you can have a look on file rom-fetch-list.txt if it
helps, and download some ROMs at your own given by those URLs. But beware,
C65 and MEGA65 ROMs - for legal reasons - are not among them.

NB: if you are interested in the MEGA65 or the C65 emulator mostly, this is
NOT the place where you can find how to get the ROMs. It's much like an
Amiga emulator, usually it's not so much advertised how to get an illegal
Kickstart ROM, even not so much to include it directly!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you have been warned. For all remaining audience here, let's continue.

Some of the ROMs though are own ones (written by me) and included in the
repository by default (even in binary form) with source. If you try to modify
the source, you need CC65 suite (the CA65 assembler from it) to be able to
assemble them. These ROMs are currently the following ones:

vic20-emulator-tool.rom

	Commodore VIC-20 autostart capable ROM with the "built in monitor".
	Currently it's not a real monitor too much, but a place where you
	can "configure" the emulator from inside :)

clcd-u104-parasite.rom

	Loads on the "top of" the clcd-u104.rom ROM, to an unused place
	of it. It aims the Commodore LCD, with some KERNAL modification,
	it will able to locate it, and also includes in the original
	"menu system" (the SHELL).

The "make" command also compile the needed ROMs/extension done by ME (not
the copyrigthed ROMs I cannot provide!). Note: these ROMs are optional,
and emulators can work without them!

This needs CC65 toolchain to be installed and their tools available (ca65,
ld65, cl65).

                       ---- ABOUT COMMODORE LCD ROMs ----

You can select various ROM patches in commodore_lcd.h

ROM_HACK_COLD_START

In the emulator, the original ROM images are patched. Note, that the emulator would
be able work with the *original* ROM images, as it should be. However these is some
problem that Commodore LCD seems to try to use SRAM as it would validly contains the
last power-on state (ie: SRAM is powered from battery even when the machine is
"switched off"). I am not sure if it's the problem of early, development ROMs, but
it seems the software fail in interesting ways if this requirement is not met. So the
two byte patch simply forces the KERNAL to re-initialize the RAM.

ROM_HACK_NEW_ROM_SEARCHING

Commodore LCD tries to find "application ROMs" (by looking for identifier string) at
every 16K, starting from physical address $20000 to $38000. Since I don't want to
"waste" the ability to use 128K of RAM, I've decided to use "unused" parts of the ROM
images. However the problem, that not fully free 16K is available, so with the default
searching MMU values, I can't put things there (which is shown by the menu system then,
etc). However, as we can see that we have "unused" MMU values as well (where no ROM
starts with the default images) I can modify values to point to ROM "window" to the
unused parts of the ROM images instead ... Ugly enough, I know. ;-)
